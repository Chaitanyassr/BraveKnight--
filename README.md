## Introduction

Brave Knight is a platform game in which a player runs, jump or collides with different object on a platform. The game follows the same format and is similar to popular games like Mario, Donkey Kong and The Legend of Zelda and works on all platforms(LINUX, IOS, Windows, Android). It is currently under construction and is being built with Godot engine. What makes this game different from other platform game is the vast variety of the functionality in which the player will be going to interact with the game world and an interactive and synergistic storyline that is just not going to mesmerize but will also  provide moral and chaste values to the younger generation.


## About the game engine

Godot engine is completely free and open - source under permissive MIT license. The best part about the engine is that it is an open source engine so anyone can find its source code on Github and can contribute towards the making of it. The game that you would be making would be all yours since it is in open source. Godot is written in C and C++. It has many stunning features that will definitely  blow up your mind. As stated on its official site, it’s unique design is as follows-

## Innovative design 



Godot engine follows a node based system architecture as we can see on the upper left side in the screenshot. A parent node has its child that actually makes the work easier. It contains various pre defined nodes such as Kinematic body and Static body and these nodes can have children like Kinematic body, which could have a sprite or an animated sprite and a collision body that would collide with the other objects in the game. Kinematic body is a special node that the user can control. Static body can also have a sprite and a collision body and it is used to make other things like platform or other object in the game with which the kinematic body can collide. A parent and a child will always be together like the sprite and the collision body would be together when the game scene would be in action . That is, if you have set a certain distance and if you define certain relationship between two children of the same parent then they would have to maintain it throughout the whole scene . The node and child based architecture allows easy handling of such system. One can easily edit the Z - index in 2-Dimensional game with the help of this system that is the sprite which has been seen above would also interact or overlap with the other in the real sense. The one higher on the series has the lowest Z - index value and the one lowest in the series would  have the highest Z - index value. We have also marked boxes specially designed  for editing Z - index value in 2 - Dimensional game.


## Gorgeous 3 - D and beautiful 2 - D



As stated in the main site of Godot engine, we can surely achieve an innovative 3 - D render design and a beautiful 2 - D design which works in pixel coordinates and have many built in tools to optimize the colour, to transform the sprite, to change the offset , animation, Z - index, to attach the script etc.



## Uncomplicated way of programing

“It is said that one can do 30 days of work in a single day when using Godot compared to other popular game engines like Unreal and Unity.”





Game can be built by using C++ or C# but godot engine also provides an alternative way to use its own language that is GD - Script  which according to me is easier than building a game in C++ or C#. It is just like python, the only difference is that you have to declare variable in it. It is object oriented and also contain some special methods like queue_free(), that could really save time and make work easier. It also has special node signal editing system on the right side that allows to connect one node to another through methods.

## Drag and Drop system


Godot engine stores a sprite or a scene(in tscn format) on the lower right side and can be easily dragged and dropped to its designated area.


## Open source

It allows anyone to contribute in the making of this glorious game engine.



# About the game “Brave Knight”

Brave knight is build by Kumar Chaitanya, who’s the scribbler  of this article and he is using Godot Engine and the infamous inbuilt language GD - Script for it. The game is open source and all the source code is available on the Github account of Chaitanya. Free sprite and tileset has been used for this game for the time being so as to keep the cost of the game at the bay. New astounding features are been added to make the game more interactive and fluid, like slow motion or screen shaking when hit by a certain object in the game. Level wise difficulty is also getting increased. It has been the deep consideration of the author to give users a good control over the player in the game in a very unhurried manner, so as to make things more engrossing. For an example, first level only have a single jump whereas second level has double jump and third has sky walk feature(from the one piece). It has been well said that-

## “Good things take time”

 So you will be going to encounter some bewildering feature in each and every level. And the difficulty level has been kept very high from the start  to make things gripping and compelling. Intelligence of the enemy would be increasing throughout the level and will be  more prominent and defined. Combat system is also under development to tackle such a robust system. The newly added feature includes artificial intelligence and moving platform in the game with a parallax background.


## The game GUI (Graphic user interface)



The game GUI is currently under development as new animated screens are being added. But for now this is the title screen.




And that's  the pause screen.


## Artificial intelligence enemy






An enemy that can follow you would surely be hard to kill.

“One can not escape the death”




## Story


A game can't survive if it doesn’t have an engaging storyline. Luckily Brave Knight has an enthralling and gripping storyline that would not only make playing Brave Knight worth it but also going to illuminate righteous values. Nothing less you can expect from a game designer who is an admirer of anime.
The story is about a Brave Knight who is returning back to the castle after doing his training. He crosses zombie land, followed by the wild and furious jungle and then the snow land to reach his destination only to find a shocking truth about the world he lives in, and the rest is up to you to explore the vast world of the Brave Knight.


## New features that would be added


Snow land - level 3
Magmapia - level 4
Split end(alternative storyline)
Character to choose(would affect the storyline)



## Future scope

Online scoreboard 
 multiplayer system
Animation (through blender)
Cut scene(through blender)

## A note from the author

This is my first game on which I have been working sincerely for the past one month. I am looking forward for companies who are willing to advertise themselves through my game pertaining to sponsorship agreements.

At last, thanks to all those who supported me in my dream journey of game making in reality.
